There is one data file, pmedcap1

This file contains the problems solved in:
[1]  I.H. Osman and N. Christofides, Capacitated clustering problems 
     by hybrid simulated annealing and tabu search,
     International Transactions in Operational Research, Vol. 1,
     No. 3, (1994) pp317-336.

The format of the data file is:
Number of problems (M)
For each problem m (m=1,...,M) in turn:
   Problem number in [1], best solution value found in [1]
   Number of customers (n), number of medians (p), capacity of each median (Q)
      For each customer i (i=1,...,n) in turn:
      customer number (i), x coordinate of i, y coordinate of i, demand of i

Note here that the computational results reported in [1] used 
euclidean distances calculated from these coordinates but 
rounded down to the nearest integer.

These problems were contributed by Dr Ibrahim H. Osman
